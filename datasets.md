#### NWPU-RESISC45 Dataset

**NWPU-RESISC45 dataset**  is  a  publicly  available  benchmark  for  REmote  Sensing  Image  Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. These 45 scene classes include airplane, airport, baseball diamond, basketball court, beach, bridge, chaparral, church, circularfarmland, cloud, commercial area, dense residential, desert, forest, freeway, golf course, ground track field, harbor, industrial area, intersection, island, lake, meadow, medium residential, mobile home park, mountain, overpass, palace, parking lot, railway, railway station, rectangular farmland, river, roundabout, runway, sea ice, ship, snowberg, sparse residential, stadium, storage tank, tennis court, terrace, thermal power station, and wetland.

<span id = "VHR10"/>

#### NWPU VHR-10 dataset

**NWPU VHR-10 dataset** is a publicly available 10-class geospatial object detection dataset used for research purposes only. These ten classes of objects are airplane, ship, storage tank, baseballdiamond, tennis court, basketball court, ground track field, harbor, bridge, and vehicle. This dataset contains totally 800 very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images that were cropped from Google Earth and Vaihingen dataset and then manually annotated by experts.

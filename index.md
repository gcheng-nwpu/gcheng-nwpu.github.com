Gong Cheng received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2007, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively. His is currently a Professor with Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China. His main research interests are computer vision, pattern recognition, and remote sensing image analysis. He has published more than 40 papers in top journals and top conferences including Proceedings of the IEEE, IEEE SPM, IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-IP, IEEE T-CSVT, IEEE T-GRS, IEEE CVPR, IJCAI, and ACM MM. 16 of his papers have been recognized as ESI highly cited papers and 9 of them have been recognized as ESI hot papers. His list of publications is available at [Google scholor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dw1n0vIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). He has been recognized as the 2018 Best Reviewer for IEEE JSTARS, and also the 2017&2018 Best Reviewer for IEEE GRSL.

Our research group release a large-scale benchmark dataset for remote sensing image scene classification, termed "NWPU-RESISC45", which consists of 31,500 images covered by 45 scene classes.

Our research group propose a large-scale benchmark dataset for object detection in optical remote sensing images, termed "DIOR", which consists of 23,463 images and 192,472 object instances.

### [DataSets]

#### NWPU-RESISC45 Dataset

**NWPU-RESISC45 dataset**  is  a  publicly  available  benchmark  for  REmote  Sensing  Image  Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. These 45 scene classes include airplane, airport, baseball diamond, basketball court, beach, bridge, chaparral, church, circularfarmland, cloud, commercial area, dense residential, desert, forest, freeway, golf course, ground track field, harbor, industrial area, intersection, island, lake, meadow, medium residential, mobile home park, mountain, overpass, palace, parking lot, railway, railway station, rectangular farmland, river, roundabout, runway, sea ice, ship, snowberg, sparse residential, stadium, storage tank, tennis court, terrace, thermal power station, and wetland.

#### NWPU VHR-10 dataset

**NWPU VHR-10 dataset** is a publicly available 10-class geospatial object detection dataset used for research purposes only. These ten classes of objects are airplane, ship, storage tank, baseballdiamond, tennis court, basketball court, ground track field, harbor, bridge, and vehicle. This dataset contains totally 800 very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images that were cropped from Google Earth and Vaihingen dataset and then manually annotated by experts.
